## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `surf` CLI

Like vscode's `code .`, we support our command `surf`

```shell

npm -g install @bridged.xyz/surf
		# or with yarn
		yarn global add @bridged.xyz/surf

# and surf üèÑ !
surf .
```





## Supported languages / frameworks

- Vue
- JS/TS/JSX/TSX (React, Svelete, and other js based frrameworks)
- Dart & Flutter





## Remote compile / App preview (for ui applications) & CLI Capabilities.

For repositories containing project such like flutter, react and other main ui frameworks we are planning to suport live-compile-preview feature of the application. the main issue with this will be the pricing and performance limitation. since we are going to keep this project free / fast for everyone
