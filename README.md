## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `surf` CLI

<p align="center"><image src="./docs/gifs/cli-demo.gif"/></p>

Like vscode's `code .`, we support our command `surf`

```shell
# === install the cli ===
npm -g install @bridged.xyz/surf
		# or with yarn
		yarn global add @bridged.xyz/surf

# and surf üèÑ !
surf .
```

You can use this as you sub editor, which can be useful when you're exploring your master/main repository when you are at your own branch on your local machine

```sh
# different branch
surf -b <branch-name>
```

## Remote compile / App preview (for ui applications) & CLI Capabilities.

For repositories containing project such like flutter, react and other main ui frameworks we are planning to suport live-compile-preview feature of the application. the main issue with this will be the pricing and performance limitation. since we are going to keep this project free / fast for everyone

The technology behind this is under development in [appbox](https://github.com/bridgedyxz/appbox) and [console](https://github.com/bridgedxyz/console.bridged.xyz). you can see the remote-compile demo on [assistant](https://github.com/bridgedxyz/assistant)
